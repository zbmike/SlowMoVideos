# SlowMoVideosShowcaseFront
Front end part of the SlowMo Videos showcase web app, built purely from functional components. Following Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's MERN course, I experiment and play around the react hooks in this project. Back end part is here: [https://github.com/zbmike/SlowmoBackend](https://github.com/zbmike/SlowmoBackend)

### This is **phase 1** of the SlowMo Video plan. The next step would be a **transcoding server** deployed on a private PC that can help transcode the videos taken from the parties in real time, and then upload them to this showcase app.
